----------------------------fMRI version of the task:------------------------------

Same settings as behavioral version, but encoding and short delay retrieval have 
noise trials because are performed inside scan.

- Encoding practice 		4  Task trials   2  Control trials   
- Encoding OA			50 Task trials   20 Control trials   17/34/51/ 70 /87/104/121
- Encoding YA			70 Task trials   20 Control trials   45/     / 90 /       135
- Encoding YA_1			50 Task trials   20 Control trials   35/     / 70 /       105 (Same lenght as OA )

- Retrieval practice 		4  Task trials   2  Control trials      
- Retrieval short delay OA      50 Task trials   20 Control trials   17/34/51/
- Retrieval short delay YA      70 Task trials   20 Control trials   30/60

- Retrieval long delay  OA      50 Task trials   20 Control trials   17/34/51/
- Retrieval long delay  YA      70 Task trials   20 Control trials   30/60
